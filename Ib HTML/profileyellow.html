               <ul>
                 <li> <strong>Name: </strong>Mary</li>
                 <li> <strong>Age: </strong>unknown (approx. 9) </li>
                 <li> <strong>Gender:</strong> female</li>
                 <li> <strong>Hair Color: </strong>blonde</li>
                 <li> <strong>Eye Color: </strong>blue</li>
               </ul>
               <p align="center"><q>I... I  was looking to see if there was anyone else too... I wanted to get out... So  I...</q> --Mary </p>
               <p align="left">Mary is the tritagonist (or antagonist,) in  the horror game Ib. She is the second, and last, person to join Ib's party.  Even though Mary seems human-like, she is actually a painting and wants to get  out of the art gallery with Ib.</p>
               <p><img src="header/appearance.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
               <p>Mary has blonde, wavy hair, big,  deep blue eyes, and pale skin. She wears a green dress and a blue neckerchief  similiar to the one that Ib wears. She also wears black knee-high socks and  shoes that are similar to school shoes. It's unknown how old Mary is, but she is speculated to be  around Ib's age.</p>
               <p><img src="header/personality.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
               <p>Mary seems to be a cute, cheerful girl at a first glance,  and is easy to open up to. She is also impatient, and often misunderstands  things. As the player comes to know her, though, it becomes obvious that she is  mentally unstable.<br />
Mary's behaviour may be the sort of behaviour her  creator, Guertena, imagined her to be like. Also, note that Mary, even if she  acts childish (which is usual for her age), shows that she is as mentally  developed as Garry, an adult.<br />
Mary is shown to dislike Garry since she may be jealous of  him and wants to use him as a human that will replace her in Guertena's  Fabricated World.  However, Mary is  two-faced and changes her mood and relation to anyone instantly, but this is  the result of her waiting for freedom. Even she doesn't show it, Mary trusts  Garry which is seen in one of the new endings, <em>Painting's Demise,</em> where  she calls for his help.&nbsp; <br /><img src="header/rose.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
               <p>Mary's rose is a fake, as it is a painting like she is.  Mary uses the yellow roses that are right below her in her painting. Her yellow  roses symbolize <em>jealousy</em>. Since her rose is fake, it's unknown how many petals her rose(s)  have. It could be possible she has 5 petals since she may be the same age as  Ib. </p>
               <p><br />
                 Also, it is possible Guertena colored her rose yellow due  to her personality. Mary is jealous, but very energetic and cheerful, happy,  and two-faced. Yellow is the color for negative and positive personalities. </p>
               <p><img src="header/role.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
               <p>When Ib and Garry meet Mary, it can be noted that Mary is  jealous of Ib and Garry's strong bond, the reason as to why she tries to take  Ib away from him. She tries to get Garry away from Ib so she can be with her,  and tries to befriend her. When she asks Ib questions about Garry, it is shown  that Mary is highly interested in how much is Ib is connected to Garry. After  Garry finds out that she is a painting, she will stand and not move, causing Ib  to worry about her. Also, she wants to get her attention by walking around the  room and talking with her about everything she knows about the real world. When  Ib goes to take the plastic key and unlock the door in the violet area of the  game, Mary will take her palette knife. <br />
Note that if Garry fails to escape the Doll Room, Mary will  tell Ib that the Garry she is with may not be the real Garry to make her leave  him. She becomes jealous of how Garry gets all of Ib's attention (ie: In the  Doll Room where Ib hugs Garry after frantically trying to snap him out of a  trance), and starts to say very strange things, and even goes as far as to  stabbing a manequin head to vent her anger towards Garry. Eventually Garry  finds out that Mary is not a real person; Mary is actually one of Guertena's  last paintings before he died that came to life, much like his other art in the  gallery. Depending on the player's choices, Mary plays an integral role in the  endings of the game. </p>
             However,  if Ib talks with Mary several times, the player may get the ending, <em>Painting's  Demise,</em> or <em>Welcome to the world of Guertena,</em> where she receives  either a bad or happy ending, but no happy ending for Ib and Garry.  </div></td>
