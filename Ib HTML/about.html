               <p> Ib (or &quot;Eve&quot;,) is a freeware Japanese psychological horror adventure game by <a href="http://kouri.kuchinawa.com/ib_g/g_top.html">kouri</a>, made in RPG Maker 2000.</p>
			   <div align="center"><q>A young girl named Ib visits an art gallery with her parents.  While observing the many exhibits, she suddenly realizes she is alone.  And in her search for others, she finds things awry in the gallery...</q>
		       </div>
			   <p>The game is focused on exploration and puzzle-solving.  There are no battles, but it may  occasionally require some quick reflexes. --<em>from <a href="http://vgperson.com/games/">vgperson</a>'s blog </em> </p>

			   <p>Guertena, also known as Guertena Weiss, is the infamous painter in the game, Ib.
               He painted Mary, as well as the other paintings in Garry and Ib 's adventure. 
               A few is known about his face. Yet, all theories stated that Guertena is either a middle-aged man or an old man. 
               In Ib v.1.04, a portrait of him is displayed, yet his face isn't shown,
               therefore concluding that Guertena is still a mystery to all. </p>
			   <p>The Fabricated World, one of Guertena's paintings, is a world based on many famous works of art by Guertena.<br />
               This world is the setting for most of the game. The main way to and from this world is through a painting of the same name in a room,
               that in the endings, ceases to exist. 
               The world is filled with many replicas of Guertena's work in the real world's gallery,
               some even coming to life and attacking Ib and Garry.</p></td>
