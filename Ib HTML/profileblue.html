			   </div>
			   <p align="left">Garry is the deuteragonist of the horror game &quot;Ib&quot; and the first character to join Ib's party. He is assumed to be around 18-21 years of  age, though his age is never revealed in the game. Not much is known about  Garry, because he doesn't tell Ib too much about himself.</p>
			   <p><img src="header/appearance.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
			   <p>Garry is tall and has a lean figure. He wears a long, dark  blue, tattered coat that he claims to be &quot;fashionable&quot;. He has light  purple hair with darker purple lowlights, pale skin and blue eyes. His hair always  covers his left eye. He wears pale brown pants and black shoes. </p>
			   <p><img src="header/personality.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
			   <p>Garry talks in a refined manner and supposedly has a  traditionally feminine personality (called lavender linguistics in Japan). 
			     Garry is mysterious, and often has mood swings (ex. when  the mannequin head scares him, at first he is frightened and then angry) but  when talking to Ib, he is kind and very nice to her from the first moment they  meet. 
			     It also shows that he has a much gentler side when Ib  faints and he covers her with his coat and even gives her a piece of lemon candy. 
		       As the game progresses, Garry continues to show signs of  protectiveness over Ib. </p>
			   <p><img src="header/rose.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
			   <p>Like Ib, Garry has a rose which represents his life, and as  it wilts, so does Garry. Garry's rose is blue which is symbolic for <em>impossible  miracles </em>(because blue roses don't exist naturally, so it seems impossible  and miraculous).His rose has 10 petals, whereas Ib's has 5. The most  likely reason is that he is an adult and Ib and Mary are just children. 
			     Also, another theory that Garry's rose is blue due to his  personality. Blue represents Garry's kindness, exoticness, mysteriousness and  mood swings, but could also represent loneliness. </p>
			   <p><img src="header/role.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
			   <p>When Ib first meets Garry, he is laying face down on the  floor. He appears to be in a great amount of pain, moaning and not moving.  After some exploring, Ib finds the Lady in Blue tearing apart a blue rose.  After getting back the blue rose, healing it, and giving it to Garry, he joins  Ib's party.</p>
			   <p><br />
			     Garry seems pretty friendly, although a little shy. After  he joins Ib's party, Garry aids Ib by clarifying words she does not know,  protecting her, and often providing commentary. Garry is more easily startled  in comparison to Ib by the events of the game. There is an instance where he  falls over in shock and several other instances where he is given the  opportunity to damage items in the gallery, which can lead to the bad endings.  He particularly has a distaste for the blue &quot;disturbing&quot; dolls.</p>
			   <p> <br />
			     In the Gray Area, Ib collapses out of exhaustion in a hallway  and Garry carries her into the &quot;safe room&quot; and covers her with his  coat. When Ib wakes up, Garry asks if she is okay and, depending upon Ib's  answer, gives her a piece of lemon candy from his coat pocket. Ib is Â able to talk to Garry directly in this room.  He mentions that he is sorry he wasn't looking out for Ib as much as he should  have been and gets surprised if Ib apologizes for causing him trouble.</p>
			   <p><br />
			     In the Violet Area, Garry is followed by a disturbing blue  doll after being separated from Mary and Ib. Garry becomes increasingly annoyed  by this, and Ib has the option of either having him set it aside or kick it.  Garry then proceeds to collect the 7 balls of paint needed for Ib to retreive  the Brown Key at an upper level. <br />
			     Garry discovers Mary's true identity in the Violet Area.  Garry can also succeed or fail inside the Doll Room, which involves him  searching for a key before time runs out. Winning the Doll Room event leads him  up the stairs to later regroup with Ib and Mary. Failing the event causes him  to hallucinate and talk to himself. He is later discovered by Ib, who snaps him  back to reality by slapping him twice. If Garry's insanity is incurable, Ib  will collapse in despair next to him and give up, leading to two possible bad  endings (&quot;Welcome to the World of Guertena&quot; and &quot;A Painting's  Demise&quot;). </p>
			   <p><br />
			     Ib gets the choice to talk with Garry again under the fake  sunlight in the Sketchbook Area. Depending on whether the player is geared  towards the best ending or the worst ending, Garry will either trade his rose  for Ib's (and subsequentially die) or he will insist on going up the stairs  into the hallway of Mary's painting. <br />
			     It is possible to receive an ending where Mary kills Garry.  If you approach Garry after his death, Ib will state that he is &quot;sleeping&quot;.  Depending on Ib's actions afterwards, the player may receive either &quot;The  Forgotten Portrait&quot; ending, the &quot;Ib All Alone&quot; ending, or the  &quot;Together, Forever&quot; ending.</p>
