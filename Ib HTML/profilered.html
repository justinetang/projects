               <ul>
                 <li><strong>Name: </strong>Ib</li>
                 <li> <strong>Age: </strong>9</li>

               <div align="center"><q>...</q> --Ib
               <p align="left">Ib (pronounced &quot;Eeb&quot;) is the silent protagonist of the horror game Ib and the first controllable character in the game. She, along with Garry and Mary (v1.04), is one of the few characters that the player can control. </p>
               </div>
               <p><img src="header/appearance.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
               <p>She is a short, 9 year old girl, with dark hair,  red eyes, and wears a white long-sleeved shirt adorned with a red bow, that is  similar to Mary's neckerchief, matching her skirt. She also wears black  knee-high socks and red shoes. Her attire is very similar to a school uniform.</p>
               <p><img src="header/personality.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
               <p>Ib's personality varies depending on the player's choices.  In other words, Ib's personality is unknown, because it is built up by the  player. The player's choices of her personality affect the game's ending (ex.  The choices the player makes affect the way Ib talks to Garry or Mary).  However, Ib is shown as extremely brave, quiet, nice, kind and profined. She is  also very sensitive to others as she felt sorry for Mary when she had to leave  her behind. Unlike Garry, she doesn't express or show her feelings too much. She appears to be a very blunt and sarcastic child as well. </p>
               <p><img src="header/rose.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
               <p>Ib picks her rose after she goes into the Fabricated World.  After she picks it, it will have only 3 petals left and after reviving it, an  inscription <em>THIEF</em> will appear on the floor printed with red paint/blood.  Her rose is red and is symbolic for <em>love</em>. Her rose has only 5 petals. 
Also, it is possible that Ib's rose is colored red due to  her personality. Red describes her kindness, energetic spirit (that children  usually have), braveness, liveliness and strong mental rank. </p>
               <p><img src="header/role.png" width="185" height="39" /></p>
               <p>She visits Guertena's museum with her parents. Her mother  gives her permission to look at the art on her own, and Ib goes on to explore  the museum by herself. Eventually, she is transported to the Fabricated World.  After exploring a while, she eventually finds a red rose. The rose is linked to  her life, and if it dies, so does she. She doesn't understand this however,  because she can't read the sign next to the rose. <br />
As Ib keeps going through, she will find an injured and  unconscious Garry holding a small key tight in his hand. After Ib picks up the  key, she will be able to interact with him and will be given two options; to  call out for help or massage his shoulders. Since he, just like Ib, is  connected to a rose, which is being torn, nothing will help him until Ib heals  his rose. </p>
               <p><br />
                 The way Ib behaves towards Garry is chosen by the player,  but is partially controlled by the game. Ib seems to like Mary, since Garry  says Ib may be sorry for leaving Mary after he defending her from Mary once he  found out/remembered the truth about her being a painting. Even after Ib  understands Mary is a painting, she doesn't think about how dangerous Mary can  be. </p>
               <p><br />
                 When Ib escapes with Garry in Mary's Sketchbook, she soon  goes to the Toy Box World after Mary pushes them into it. Depending on the  conversations between Mary and Ib, she may or may not be able to find her rose.  If there are no petals above Ib after she wakes up, her rose can't be found. If  the petals of her rose are seen above Ib, they will be lead to the rose. If the  pink key is picked up before the rose, the same thing will happen as if there  is no rose in the Toy Box, so note that Ib must pick up the rose before taking  the key. </p>
               <p><br />
                 The different choices the player chooses affect which  ending will be displayed.</p>
